Balancd is a balatro mod that I've been working on (with plenty of procrastination) since about February.

I had a lot of fun diving into Balatro's source code, and getting accustomed to it. Overall, it was a fun experience.

Enough about me, now about the mod!

Adds 2 mechanics: FHR and Charring
FHR: Some jokers can trigger Full Hand Retriggers, which will reactivate all cards played in the middle of joker evaluation. Abuse this as much as you can!
Charring: Jokers have a base 1/20 chance when destroyed to come back from death and reintroduce themselves to your deck with the Charred edition. Jokers use this mechanic.

Adds 18 jokers
Adds 2 vouchers

Might add even more in the future!
